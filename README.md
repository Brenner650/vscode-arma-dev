## Features

* Build your extension or add existing into the Arma-Dev configuration
* Pack server and client pbo files (incl. signing) with a single command
* Preview Dialog control files (*.hpp)
* Generate private keys
* Install the client mod into the correct game directory
* Run and debug (using *.RPT file) on the fly

## Usage

Before using the Arma Dev extension, please make sure you have properly installed the Arma 3 Tools from Steam.

Open your existing Arma (server / client) and run the `Arma 3: Configure` command to setup the project.
Please refer to the **Configuration** section for further details

Below you can find all available commands

* `Arma 3: Configure`: to setup the project
* `Arma 3: Build`: to pack / build pbos defined in your configuration file
* `Arma 3: Binarize`: binarize cpp files from explorer context menu
* `Arma 3: UnBinarize`: Unbinarize bin files from explorer context menu
* `Arma 3: Run Server`: start the arma3server with server mod path included
* `Arma 3: Run Client`: to start the game from your local computer
* `Arma 3: Run Client (With Logging)`: to start the game and display the logfile
* `Arma 3: Generate Key`: generate a private key to sign the client pbo's
* `Arma 3: Transfer Files`: transfer server pbos to destination server using SFTP
* `Arma 3: Toggle Code Live`: please read the below "Toggle Code Live" section for further details

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in `.vscode/arma-dev.json` and contains the following options.

* `title`: The title of your project (no used yet)
* `name`: The short name of the addon (this name is used as output folder)
* `author`: author name
* `steamPath`: The default steam path used for this project (default: auto-detect)
* `buildPath`: destination folder of all pbo files being generated
* `privateKey`: the private key path being used to sign the client addon
* `serverDir`: all server directories a pbo files should be created for (E.g. core and core_config)
* `serverUse32bit`: use legacy 32bit version of arma3server.exe
* `serverMods`: additional server mods being loaded when running arma3server
* `clientDirs`: all client directories a pbo files should be created for (ussualy its one or none)
* `clientMods`: additional client mods being loaded when running arma 3
* `version`: a version number to track possible changes (not immplemented) 
* `ftpConnection`: setup SFTP connection using host, username and password (optionally path)
* `ftpConnectionFile`: setup SFTP connection by using a separate file
* `postProcess`: run some additional scripts once a command has been successfully executed - see "Post Processing"

## Toggle Code Live

### PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY

With "Code live" you can edit *.sqf files while Arma is running.
It uses symlinks (refering to its workspace source) and the `-filePatching` [startup parameter](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Startup_Parameters).

A proper configured $PBOPREFIX$ for every addon file is required

So, how to use it

* Run the command `Arma 3: Toggle Code Live` to create all necessary symlinks into "Arma 3\x" directory
* use `Arma 3: Run Client` to start Arma with all necessary parameters (-filePatching)
* use `Arma 3: Run Server` to prepare a server configuration and run it
* Customize the files defined in your workspace source folder.
* Open the in-game debug console and either use `execVM` or `preprocessFile*` to "reload" the changes.
* If you use a preInit script (which DOES NOT use `compileFinal`) you can use `execVM` too

Please be aware of the following

* Server config.cfg requires `allowedFilePatching = 2;` (which is ussually the case when running with `Arma 3: Run Server`)
* No server side signatur verification will work, so `verifySignatures = 0;` to bypass it
* You can toggle `Code Live` to either use the source or PBO file (located in buildPath)
* Some commands / settings (like `compileFinal` / config.cpp) cannot be overwritten (anti cheat)

**HINT: Use `[] spawn { compile preProcessFile "x\youraddon\yourfile.sqf" };` instead of `execVM "x\youraddon\yourfile.sqf"` from console to update file modifications**

## Post Processing

The post processing option (defined in `.vscode/arma-dev.json`) can be helpful to run additional tasks once a command has been successfully executed.
An example of running a script when for instance *all files are transfered to the remote* can look the following:

```json
"postProcess": {
    "transferFiles": "./restart-server.ps1"
}
```

Please note these commands are always executed locally

## Requirements

* Arma 3 Tools (http://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/)
* Visual Studio Code

PLEASE MAKE SURE STEAM IS RUNNING AS IT IS REQUIRED FOR PACKING

## Extension Settings

* `arma-dev.logLevel`: setup the log level (Info | Debug | Error)
* `arma-dev.dialogAxisMode`: How to display the dialog control axis (0 = truncated, 1 = original) **restart required**
* `arma-dev.steamPath`: The default steam path used for arma-dev (default: auto-detect)
