# Release Notes

Use `Arma 3: Run Server` to start an arma3server instance locally.
It is shipped with a default server configuration (server.cfg) and mission file (mission.sqm)

* server.cfg located in `%APPDATA%\Arma 3\ArmaDevServer\server.cfg`
* mission.sqp located in `<GameDir>\mpmissions\ArmaDev.VR`

The server parameters are properly set by default, you only need to run it.
Of course, the logfile will be opened, too
